- When I started my research in semiconductors,
0:01
I thought that because chips were everywhere,
0:04
chips were easy to make.
0:05
And because nuclear bombs
0:06
were only controlled by a handful of governments,
0:08
they were hard to make.
0:09
But what I realized is actually the exact opposite.
0:12
If you take nuclear weapons,
0:14
that technology has barely improved since the 1960s.
0:17
It's so easy to make nuclear bombs,
0:19
even the North Koreans can do it.
0:21
But chips are everywhere
0:22
because they're cheap and they're tiny.
0:24
And making things very inexpensive and very small
0:28
is extraordinarily difficult.
0:30
Today, there are just three companies capable of producing
0:33
cutting-edge processor chips,
0:34
the types of chips that go in phones or computers
0:37
or are used for AI.
0:39
For many of those devices they rely on chips that,
0:42
in some cases, can only be made by one company
0:45
in a single factory in Taiwan.
0:49
The key risk that hangs over not just the chip industry,
0:51
but really our entire economy
0:53
is that something goes wrong between China and Taiwan
0:56
in the Taiwan Straits,
0:57
such that we lose access to chips made in Taiwan.
1:02
My name is Chris Miller.
1:03
I'm a professor at the Fletcher School
1:05
and author of "Chip War:
1:07
The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology."
1:18
Well, I first got interested in chips
1:19
when I realized you really couldn't understand
1:21
how the world works without them.
1:23
When we think about technology,
1:24
we think about social media, we think about search engines,
1:27
we think about apps on our phones,
1:29
but undergirding all of this are chips.
1:33
A chip is a piece of silicon,
1:34
often the size of your fingernail,
1:36
and in it is carved thousands or millions,
1:39
in some cases billions of tiny devices called transistors,
1:43
which flip circuits on or off, on and off.
1:46
And when they're on, they produce a one.
1:47
When they're off, they produce a zero,
1:49
and all of the ones and zeros,
1:50
undergirding computing, undergirding data storage,
1:53
all of your Instagram likes, all of your text messages,
1:56
these are all just long strings of ones and zeros,
1:58
which are created on the chip
1:59
by these circuits flipping on and off.
2:03
Before transistors, computers used vacuum tubes,
2:06
which were sort of light bulb-like devices
2:08
that would turn on and off, on and off,
2:09
to produce the ones and zeros.
2:12
They were cutting edge for their time,
2:14
but they had huge inefficiencies.
2:16
They wasted a lot of heat, for example,
2:18
they worked pretty slowly,
2:19
and they also, because they created light,
2:21
attracted moths.
2:23
And so computers had to be regularly debugged
2:26
in the early days of computing,
2:27
which meant removing moths
2:28
from the lights that they were attracted to.
2:31
In the middle of the 20th century,
2:33
William Shockley, John Bardeen, and Walter Brattain
2:35
invented the first transistor
2:37
while they were working at Bell Labs,
2:39
It was part of AT&T at the time.
2:41
- [Narrator] Invented at the laboratories,
2:43
the transistor brought Bell scientists,
2:45
one of the two Nobel prizes
2:47
they have won for discoveries in physics.
2:50
- [Chris] They were initially planning
2:51
to use these transistors as part of the telephone network.
2:53
- [Narrator] Though it was primarily developed
2:55
for the betterment of telephone communications,
2:58
the versatile transistor now appears
3:00
in a staggering variety of devices and equipment.
3:04
- [Chris] Individual transistors were connected via wires
3:07
in a way that was okay if you had a handful of transistors,
3:09
but if you had a thousand connected together,
3:11
you had a jungle of wires you had to manage.
3:14
The first chips were invented
3:15
by engineers working at Texas Instruments
3:18
and a company called Fairchild Semiconductor
3:20
in Silicon Valley.
3:22
The first engineers realized
3:24
that you could take multiple transistors
3:26
and make them on a single piece of semiconductor material.
3:31
And so that was the first chip,
3:33
a piece of material with multiple transistors
3:35
carved into it.
3:36
- [Narrator] This single silicon crystal will be trimmed,
3:39
then sliced and diced.
3:42
The objective: semiconductors.
3:45
Patterns are made by a photographic process
3:47
and then micro-machined by chemical etching
3:50
to produce nearly 1,700 transistors on each slice.
3:55
- [Chris] And so the jungle of connections
3:57
was replaced by a single block of material,
3:59
which was much more reliable
4:01
and also much more easy to shrink in its size.
4:05
At first, they were building chips
4:06
primarily for the US government,
4:08
for the space program for example,
4:09
and for weapons systems.
4:10
But they realized early on
4:12
you could take the exact same chips
4:13
that the government wanted to guide spacecraft
4:16
and use them for commercial applications
4:18
like computers or pocket calculators.
4:20
And that set the industry off
4:22
into its first phase of growth in the 1960s and '70s.
4:25
- [Narrator] All the calculator know-how
4:27
you'll probably ever need.
4:29
- [Chris] Over time a new set of companies emerged.
4:31
Intel, for example, was founded in 1969.
4:34
And it quickly focused on making chips
4:37
for personal computers,
4:39
which at the time was a very small market,
4:40
but they correctly bet that
4:42
soon everyone would have a personal computer.
4:44
And Intel, even today,
4:46
is the world's largest producer of chips that go inside PCs.
4:51
Gordon Moore was one of the two co-founders of Intel.
4:54
He's most famous today probably
4:56
for coining the term Moore's Law.
4:58
Moore's Law is not a law of nature.
5:00
It's not a law of physics.
5:01
It's really a law of economics.
5:03
Moore's Law predicts that the number of transistors per chip
5:07
and as a result of the computing power per chip will double
5:09
every couple of years.
5:11
And that's been empirically true since the 1960s.
5:15
If you're able to find a way to shrink,
5:17
shrink your transistors smaller,
5:19
you will be able to find a larger market as well.
5:22
And that has incentivized huge investments in shrinking,
5:26
in improving manufacturing processes,
5:28
in making chemicals more purified,
5:30
which means that the capabilities of chips
5:32
have gotten vastly better
5:34
and continued to get much, much better
5:36
at a faster rate than anything else.
5:38
So I like to think, for example,
5:40
of airplanes to illustrate the difference.
5:42
If airplanes doubled in speed every two years
5:45
from the 1960s up to the present,
5:46
we'd be flying faster literally than the speed of light.
5:49
But chips have done that.
5:50
Chips have increased in that capability
5:52
because the scale of the transistors has shrunk.
5:56
Chips today are measured in nanometers,
5:59
and so that makes them only slightly larger than atoms,
6:02
far smaller than a bacteria,
6:03
smaller than a mitochondria,
6:05
half the size, for the most cutting-edge transistors,
6:07
of a coronavirus.
6:09
There's basically nothing we manufacture at such tiny scale.
6:15
When you go inside one of these massive facilities
6:17
called fabs,
6:19
what you find is that there are huge machines
6:21
and not much else,
6:23
because humans are way too imprecise
6:25
for manufacturing at nanometer scale.
6:28
The machines that make chips can cost $350 million apiece.
6:32
And they cost so much because they require
6:34
some of the most precise components ever used,
6:37
like a mirror that's the flattest mirror
6:39
humans have ever made,
6:40
a laser that's the most powerful laser ever deployed
6:43
in a commercial device,
6:44
and a ball of tin that falls through a vacuum
6:47
and then is struck twice by that laser,
6:49
explodes into a plasma measuring 40 times the temperature
6:53
of the surface of the sun,
6:54
and this plasma emits light at just the right wavelength,
6:57
13.5 nanometers, to be bounced off the mirrors
7:00
in exactly the right geometry
7:02
and land on your chip
7:03
to carve the transistors into the silicon.
7:07
It's the most complex and expensive machine
7:09
that humans have ever made,
7:11
and it's required to make all of the most advanced chips.
7:15
And that has enabled the explosion of computing power,
7:18
both in terms of the computing capabilities
7:21
in high-powered data centers or in your phone,
7:23
but also the application of computing
7:25
to all sorts of devices.
7:27
Today, there's computing everywhere.
7:28
It's in your dishwasher, it's in your refrigerator,
7:30
it's in your coffee maker, it's in your car,
7:32
and it's possible to put computing everywhere
7:34
because today it's so cheap,
7:35
we can produce it almost for free.
7:41
The chip industry was a global industry
7:43
from really the earliest days.
7:47
Because chipmaking requires ultra purified materials
7:50
and hugely complex equipment,
7:52
everyone requires a set of partnerships
7:55
to give them the materials, and the intellectual property,
7:57
and the software, and the tools that they need
8:00
to produce advanced chips.
8:03
So in the US right now,
8:04
most of the key chip firms only design chips.
8:08
Most of the manufacturing of chips happens
8:10
in East Asia, in Taiwan, for example, or in Korea.
8:15
Many of the chemicals
8:16
that go into chipmaking come from Japan.
8:19
And the machines that are used to make chips
8:21
come from either Silicon Valley
8:22
where some of them are still made,
8:24
or the Netherlands, or Japan.
8:27
So the industry has globalized,
8:29
but it's also specialized in the process.
8:31
And so there's not a single region today
8:33
that can make cutting-edge chips on its own.
8:35
If you take for example,
8:36
the primary processor inside of your smartphone,
8:39
it was probably made in Taiwan,
8:41
but it was made in Taiwan using chipmaking tools
8:44
from the Netherlands, and from the United States,
8:45
and from Japan.
8:46
It was produced using chemicals from Japan.
8:49
And then often assembled and packaged in Malaysia
8:52
before ending up inside of your smartphone.
8:54
And that's typical.
8:57
During the pandemic,
8:59
the supply and demand dynamics from the chip industry
9:02
were out of whack.
9:04
A lot of people ordered new computers,
9:06
for example, to work from home,
9:07
and so PC production shot up in ways that weren't expected,
9:10
or people bought fewer cars
9:12
in the early days of the pandemic
9:13
and so car production declined.
9:14
And companies couldn't predict
9:15
what type of chip they would need.
9:18
The effect of that was
9:19
to create shortages of certain types of chips.
9:22
Car companies in particular
9:23
found they couldn't get the types of chips
9:25
that they rely on.
9:27
The thing about cars if you're missing just one chip,
9:29
your car often doesn't work.
9:30
And during the pandemic,
9:31
car companies found themselves often in that situation.
9:34
Just a a single chip,
9:35
often even the cheapest chips were causing them
9:38
to have to leave cars in the factory parking lot
9:40
while they waited for the right chip to arrive.
9:44
That created hundreds of billions of dollars of losses
9:48
for manufacturers like automakers.
9:50
And that matters
9:51
because the shortages we saw in 2021 and 2022 are tiny
9:56
in comparison to the shortages we would see
9:58
if something happened to a large-scale chipmaker
10:01
like those in Taiwan.
10:05
The biggest chipmaker in the world
10:07
is the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.
10:10
When it comes to advanced processor chips,
10:12
like the chips in your phone or the chips in your computer,
10:15
TSMC makes around 90% of them.
10:18
In 1987, there was an American engineer named Morris Chang.
10:23
The Taiwanese approached him and said,
10:24
would you like to build a chip factory in Taiwan?
10:28
And he said, "Yes."
10:30
At the time, most chips were manufactured and designed
10:33
by the same companies.
10:34
But he established TSMC in Taiwan
10:37
with the aim never of designing chips,
10:39
only of manufacturing.
10:41
That's exactly what TSMC has done
10:43
and it's enabled TSMC to win among its customers
10:46
some of the largest companies in the world.
10:48
Apple, Nvidia, Qualcomm, AMD,
10:50
they all rely on TSMC to produce its chips,
10:53
which means that TSMC
10:54
is the largest chipmaker in the world by far.
10:56
They've got an extraordinary market share
10:58
and are arguably the most important company in the world
11:00
because the chips that they produce,
11:02
we rely on for basically everything.
11:04
- [Reporter] China and Taiwan have been at odds
11:07
ever since Chiang Kai-shek
11:09
and what was left of the Nationalist Army
11:12
fled the mainland for the islands back in 1949.
11:16
- [Chris] Anything that disrupted ship production in Taiwan
11:18
would be catastrophic for the world economy.
11:21
Especially if China carries
11:23
through on the threats it regularly makes
11:25
to use force against Taiwan to take control of the island.
11:29
- [Reporter] China fired 11 ballistic missiles
11:31
right over the island
11:33
and encircled it with warships
11:35
to prove it can strangle Taiwan whenever it wants.
11:39
- Even a small move, a small conflict,
11:42
would be disastrous for the chip industry
11:44
because Taiwan needs to import energy,
11:46
it needs to import chemicals, materials, tools,
11:49
spare parts from Japan, from the United States, from Europe,
11:53
energy coming in from the Middle East.
11:55
And if any of this is disrupted,
11:57
chip production could break down.
11:59
And if chip production in Taiwan breaks down,
12:00
that matters for everyone,
12:02
because everyone uses Taiwanese-made chips.
12:08
Both China and the US see chips as really central
12:11
to the technology competition between them right now.
12:15
China's worried that
12:16
because it relies on importing chips
12:19
from Taiwan and from Korea, which are both US allies,
12:22
it's gonna be cut off in the future
12:24
from getting to the chips that it needs.
12:26
And right now, that's already happening to some degree.
12:28
The US is limiting the ability of AI firms like Nvidia
12:31
to sell their most cutting-edge chips to China.
12:34
And the aim of these regulations is
12:36
to give US firms an advantage,
12:38
to make sure that US companies are leaders in AI
12:40
and that the US gets to write the rules
12:42
of how AI will play out.
12:45
Today, China's the world's largest importer of chips.
12:49
They spend as much money each year importing chips
12:51
as they spend importing oil.
12:53
There's nothing that China's more reliant
12:55
on the outside world to purchase.
12:58
Right now, the most advanced Chinese firm, SMIC,
13:02
is about five years behind TSMC.
13:04
Which might not sound like a lot,
13:06
but that's 2 1/2 Moore's Laws behind TSMC,
13:09
which means that for the most-cutting edge applications,
13:11
you really take a performance hit
13:13
if you want to use a Chinese manufacturer
13:15
versus a Taiwanese one.
13:17
And that's the US goal
13:18
to kind of throw sand in the gears of China's AI ecosystem
13:22
and hope that the US can race ahead as a result.
13:27
The biggest change in the past couple of years
13:29
has been the explosion of investment in AI.
13:32
I think the release of ChatGPT in late 2022
13:35
encouraged all the big tech firms
13:37
to spend tens of billions of dollars
13:39
building vast AI infrastructure,
13:41
which means data centers
13:42
full of the most capable semiconductors.
13:46
One of the key trends in the history of AI is that
13:48
more advanced systems require
13:50
being trained on larger volumes of data.
13:53
If you wanna train a system on more data,
13:54
you need more computing power,
13:55
which means better chips to train it.
13:58
And so today,
13:59
companies like OpenAI or Anthropic are spending
14:01
millions and millions and soon billions of dollars
14:03
training their AI systems.
14:05
And most of that budget goes to buying chips,
14:08
buying ultra-advanced semiconductors
14:09
from companies like Nvidia.
14:11
One of the key challenges of AI is gonna be
14:13
to drive down the cost of deploying AI systems.
14:17
To make AI really widespread across the economy,
14:20
we need the cost of using it to be so cheap
14:22
we don't even think about it.
14:24
It's sort of like Google search today.
14:26
No one thinks what's the price of my Google search,
14:28
because it's approximately zero.
14:30
Google spends a bit of money on the data centers,
14:32
but it's so low, you don't have to think about it.
14:34
Today, AI is actually pretty expensive.
14:36
A single query to ChatGPT is an appreciable amount of money.
14:40
There are a lot of companies that are exploring
14:41
how do you do deployment more efficiently.
14:46
Nvidia's chips, which are at the center
14:48
of the AI ecosystem right now,
14:51
are pretty general purpose in their capabilities.
14:53
They can train many different types of models
14:55
and are useful both for training and also for deployment.
14:59
But if you design a chip for a specific type of model
15:03
or a specific type of deployment,
15:05
you can make it perfectly optimized for that use case.
15:08
And so a lot of startups right now
15:09
are looking at individual workloads
15:12
or individual deployment opportunities and saying,
15:14
we're gonna design a chip
15:15
that's perfectly tweaked for that use case.
15:18
This is startups tackling this industry,
15:20
but it's also big tech companies.
15:21
Facebook, Microsoft, Google,
15:23
they're all designing their own in-house chips as well,
15:26
because they know the specific workloads
15:28
that are inside their data centers
15:29
and they've realized
15:31
if they design chips specifically around those workloads,
15:33
they can operate more efficiently in many cases
15:36
than a general purpose AI chip like Nvidia's can do.
15:39
Which I think is gonna be really important
15:40
in making AI cheap enough and therefore prolific enough
15:44
to make a major impact on the economy.
15:47
When I look at the surge of investment
15:48
in AI chips right now,
15:50
I see no reason to doubt that Moore's Law
15:52
won't continue for a very long time.
15:54
That means more advanced chips,
15:56
which means more computing power
15:58
that we can apply to all sorts of uses,
16:00
AI and all sorts of devices.
16:02
And that means we'll be using even more semiconductors
16:04
because the trend has been that
16:06
as chips get better, they get cheaper,
16:09
and we put them in more and more types of uses.
16:13
Today, if your car has a thousand chips,
16:15
I wouldn't be surprised if it has 10X that number
16:18
in a decade.
16:20
And that basic trend is true of everything we rely on.
