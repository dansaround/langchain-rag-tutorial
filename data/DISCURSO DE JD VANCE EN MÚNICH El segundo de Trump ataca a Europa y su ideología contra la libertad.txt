0:00
and we are very happy that he has come
0:02
back to Munich and um we are very much
0:06
looking forward um to his speech please
0:09
welcome vice president JD
0:21
Vance well thank you and uh thanks to
0:24
all the uh the gathered delegates and
0:26
luminaries and media professionals and
0:30
thank thanks especially to the hosts of
0:31
the Munich security conference for being
0:34
able to to put on such an incredible
0:35
event we're of course thrilled to be
0:37
here we're happy to be here and you know
0:40
one of the things that I wanted to to
0:43
talk about today is of course our shared
0:46
values and you know it's it's great to
0:48
be back in Germany as as you heard
0:49
earlier I was here last year as United
0:51
States Senator I saw uh foreign minister
0:54
excuse me foreign secretary David lamby
0:56
and jok that both of us last year had
0:57
different jobs than we have now but now
1:00
it's time uh for all of our countries
1:02
for all of those who have been fortunate
1:05
enough to be given political power by
1:07
our respective peoples to use it wisely
1:09
to improve their lives and I want to say
1:12
that you know I was fortunate in my time
1:14
here to spend some time outside the
1:16
walls of this conference over the last
1:18
24 hours and I've been so impressed by
1:22
the hospitality of the people even as
1:25
course as they're reeling from
1:26
yesterday's horrendous attack and the
1:29
first time time I was ever in Munich was
1:31
with was with my wife actually who's
1:33
here with me today um on a personal trip
1:36
and I've always loved the city of Munich
1:38
and I've always loved its people and I
1:40
just want to say that we're very moved
1:41
and our thoughts and prayers are with
1:43
Munich and everybody affected by the
1:45
evil and inflicted on this beautiful
1:47
Community we're thinking about you we're
1:49
praying for you and we will certainly be
1:52
rooting for you in the days and weeks to
1:54
come now
2:02
I hope that's not the last bit of
2:03
Applause that I get but we We Gather at
2:07
at this conference of course to discuss
2:10
security and normally we mean threats to
2:13
our external security I see M many great
2:16
military leaders gathered here today but
2:18
while the Trump Administration is very
2:21
concerned with European security and
2:24
believes that we can come to a
2:26
reasonable settlement between Russia and
2:28
Ukraine and we also believe that it's
2:30
important in the coming years for Europe
2:32
to step up in a big way to provide for
2:35
its own defense the threat that I worry
2:38
the most about vvv Europe is not Russia
2:41
it's not China it's not any other
2:43
external actor and what I worry about is
2:46
the threat from within the retreat of
2:50
Europe from some of its most fundamental
2:53
values values shared with the United
2:55
States of America now I was struck that
2:58
a former European commissioner went on
3:00
television recently and sounded
3:03
delighted that the Romanian government
3:05
had just annuled an entire election he
3:09
warned that if things don't go to plan
3:12
the very same thing could happen in
3:14
Germany
3:15
too now these Cavalier statements are
3:18
shocking to American ears for years
3:21
we've been told that everything we fund
3:23
and support is in the name of our shared
3:26
Democratic Values everything from our
3:29
Ukraine policy to digital censorship is
3:32
build as a defense of
3:36
democracy but when we see European
3:38
courts cancelling elections and Senior
3:41
officials threatening to cancel others
3:44
we ought to ask whether we're holding
3:46
ourselves to an appropriately high
3:48
standard and I say ourselves because I
3:50
fundamentally believe that we are on the
3:52
same team we must do more than talk
3:55
about Democratic Values we must live
3:58
them now with living memory of many of
4:01
you in this room the Cold War positioned
4:04
Defenders of democracy against much more
4:07
tyrannical forces on this continent and
4:10
consider the side in that fight that
4:13
censored dissident that closed churches
4:17
that cancelled elections were they the
4:19
good guys certainly not and thank God
4:22
they lost the Cold War they lost because
4:26
they neither valued nor respected all of
4:29
the extraordinary blessings of liberty
4:31
the freedom to surprise to make mistakes
4:35
invent to build as it turns out you
4:38
can't mandate Innovation or creativity
4:41
just as you can't force people what to
4:43
think what to feel or what to believe
4:46
and we believe those things are
4:47
certainly connected and unfortunately
4:50
when I look at Europe today it's
4:52
sometimes not so clear what happened to
4:55
some of the cold Wars winners I Look to
4:59
Brussels
5:00
where EU commiss commissars warn
5:02
citizens that they intend to shut down
5:04
social media during times of civil
5:06
unrest the moment they spot what they've
5:09
judged to be quote hateful content or to
5:13
this very country where police have
5:16
carried out raids against citizens
5:17
suspected of posting anti-feminist
5:20
comments online as part of quote
5:23
combating misogyny on the internet a day
5:25
of
5:26
action I Look to Sweden where two weeks
5:29
ago the government convicted a Christian
5:31
activist for participating in Quan
5:34
burnings that resulted in his friend's
5:37
murder and as the judge in his case
5:39
chillingly noted Sweden's laws to
5:42
supposedly Protect free expression do
5:45
not in fact Grant and I'm quoting a free
5:49
pass to do or say anything without
5:52
risking offending the group that holds
5:55
that
5:56
belief and perhaps most concerningly I
5:59
Look to to our very dear friends the
6:00
United Kingdom where the backslide away
6:03
from conscience rights has placed the
6:05
basic Liberties of religious Britain in
6:07
particular in the
6:08
crosshairs a little over two years ago
6:11
the British government charged Adam
6:12
Smith Connor a 51-year-old
6:15
physiotherapist and an army veteran with
6:18
the heinous crime of standing 50 m from
6:22
an abortion clinic and silently praying
6:25
for 3 minutes not obstructing anyone not
6:29
interacting with anyone just silently
6:31
praying on his
6:33
own after British law enforcement
6:35
spotted him and demanded to know what he
6:37
was praying for Adam replied simply it
6:40
was on behalf of The Unborn son he and
6:43
his former girlfriend had aborted years
6:46
before now the officers were not moved
6:49
Adam was found guilty of breaking the
6:52
government's new buffer zones law which
6:54
criminalizes silent pray and other
6:56
actions that could influence a person's
6:58
decision within 200 M of an abortion
7:01
facility he was sentenced to pay
7:03
thousands of pounds in legal costs to
7:05
the
7:06
prosecution now I wish I could say that
7:08
this was a fluke a one-off crazy example
7:10
of a badly written law being enacted
7:13
against a single person but no this last
7:17
October just a few months ago the
7:18
Scottish government began Distributing
7:20
letters to Citizens whose houses lay
7:22
within so-called safe access zones
7:25
warning them that even private prayer
7:28
within their own homes
7:30
May amount to Breaking the
7:32
Law naturally the government readers to
7:35
report any fellow citizen suspected
7:37
guilty of thought crime in Britain and
7:41
across Europe free speech I fear is in
7:45
Retreat and in the interest of Comedy my
7:47
friends but also in the interest of
7:49
truth I will admit that sometimes the
7:52
loudest voices for sensorship have come
7:54
not from within Europe but from within
7:57
my own country where the prior
7:59
Administration threatened and bullied
8:01
social media companies to censor
8:03
so-called
8:04
misinformation misinformation like for
8:07
example the idea that Corona virus had
8:09
likely leaked from leaked from a
8:11
laboratory in China our own government
8:14
encouraged private companies to silence
8:17
people who dared to utter what turned
8:20
out to be an obvious truth so I come
8:23
here today not just with an observation
8:25
but with an offer and just as the B
8:28
Administration desperate to silence
8:30
people for speaking their minds so the
8:33
Trump Administration will do precisely
8:36
the opposite and I hope that we can work
8:38
together on that in Washington there is
8:41
a new sheriff in town and under Donald
8:43
Trump's leadership we may disagree with
8:46
your views but we will fight to defend
8:48
your right to offer in the Public Square
8:51
agree or
8:57
disagree now we're at the point of
9:00
course that the the situation has gotten
9:02
so bad that this December ROM Romania
9:05
straight up canel the results of a
9:07
presidential election based on the
9:09
flimsy suspicions of an intelligence
9:12
agency and enormous pressure from its
9:15
Continental neighbors now as I
9:17
understand it the argument was that
9:19
Russian disinformation had infected the
9:22
Romanian elections but I'd ask my
9:25
European friends to have some
9:27
perspective you can believe
9:29
it's wrong for Russia to buy social
9:31
media advertisements to influence your
9:33
elections we certainly do you can
9:36
condemn it on the world stage even but
9:38
if your democracy can be destroyed with
9:40
a few hundred, of digital advertising
9:43
from a foreign country then it wasn't
9:45
very strong to begin
9:51
with now the good news is that I happen
9:54
to think your democracies are
9:55
substantially less brittle than many
9:58
people apparently fear
9:59
and I really do believe that allowing
10:01
our citizens to speak their mind will
10:03
make them stronger still which of course
10:07
brings us back to Munich where the
10:10
organizers of this very conference have
10:12
banned lawmakers representing populist
10:14
parties on both the left and the right
10:16
from participating in these
10:18
conversations now again we don't have to
10:20
agree with everything or anything that
10:24
people say but when people represent
10:27
when political leaders represent in
10:29
important constituency it is incumbent
10:31
upon us to at least participate in
10:34
dialogue with them now to many of us on
10:37
the other side of the Atlantic it looks
10:39
more and more like old entrenched
10:41
interests hiding behind ugly Soviet era
10:45
words like misinformation and
10:47
disinformation who simply don't like the
10:49
idea that somebody with an alternative
10:51
Viewpoint might Express a different
10:54
opinion or God forbid vote a different
10:57
way or even worse first win an
11:01
election now this is a security
11:04
conference and I'm sure you all came
11:05
here prepared to talk about how exactly
11:07
you ATT tend to increase defense
11:09
spending over the next few years in line
11:12
with some new Target and that's great
11:15
because as president Trump has made
11:16
abundantly clear he believes that our
11:19
European friends must play a bigger role
11:22
in the future of this continent we don't
11:24
think you hear this term burden sharing
11:27
but we think it's an important part of
11:29
being in a shared Alliance together that
11:31
the Europeans step up while America
11:33
focuses on areas of the world that are
11:36
in great danger but let me also ask you
11:40
how will you even begin to think through
11:42
the kinds of budgeting questions if we
11:45
don't know what it is that we are
11:47
defending in the first place I've heard
11:50
a lot already in my conversations and
11:52
I've had many many great conversations
11:54
with many people gathered here in this
11:56
room I've heard a lot about what you
11:58
need to defend yourselves from and of
12:00
course that's important but what has
12:02
seemed a little bit less clear to me and
12:05
certainly I think to many of the
12:07
citizens of Europe is what exactly it is
12:09
that you're defending yourselves for
12:12
what is the positive Vision that
12:14
animates this shared security compact
12:17
that we all believe is so important and
12:20
I believe deeply that there is no
12:24
security if you are afraid of the voices
12:27
the opinions and the conscience that
12:30
guide your very own people Europe faces
12:34
many challenges but the crisis this
12:36
continent faces right now the crisis I
12:38
believe we all face together is one of
12:42
our own
12:43
making if you're running in fear of your
12:46
own voters there is nothing America can
12:49
do for you nor for that matter is there
12:51
anything that you can do for the
12:53
American people who elected me and
12:56
elected president Trump you need
12:58
Democrat mandates to accomplish anything
13:01
of value in the coming years have we
13:02
learned nothing that thin mandates
13:05
produce unstable results but there is so
13:09
much of value that can be accomplished
13:12
with the kind of democratic mandate that
13:14
I think will come from being more
13:16
responsive to the voices of your
13:18
citizens if you're going to enjoy
13:20
competitive economies if you're going to
13:22
enjoy affordable energy and secure
13:25
Supply
13:26
chains then you need man Ates to govern
13:30
because you have to make difficult
13:32
choices to enjoy all of these things and
13:34
of course we know that very well in
13:36
America you cannot win a democratic
13:38
mandate by censoring your opponents or
13:40
putting them in jail whether that's the
13:42
leader of the opposition a humble
13:44
Christian praying in her own home or a
13:47
journalist trying to report the
13:49
news nor can you win one by disregarding
13:52
your basic electorate on questions like
13:55
who gets to be a part of our shared
13:57
society and of all the pressings
14:00
challenges that the Nations represented
14:02
here face I believe there is nothing
14:04
more
14:05
urgent than Mass
14:08
migration today almost one in5 people
14:11
living in this country moved here from
14:13
abroad that is of course an all-time
14:15
high it's a similar number by the way in
14:17
the United States also an all-time high
14:20
the number of immigrants who entered the
14:21
EU from non countries doubled between
14:25
2021 and 2022 alone and of course it's
14:28
gotten much higher sense and we know
14:31
this situation it didn't materialize in
14:33
a vacuum it's a result of a series of
14:37
conscious decisions made by politicians
14:40
all over the continent and others across
14:43
the world over the span of a
14:46
decade we saw the horrors wrought by
14:48
these decisions yesterday in this very
14:51
City and of course I can't bring it up
14:54
again without thinking about the
14:57
terrible victims who had a beautiful
14:59
winter day in Munich ruined our thoughts
15:02
and prayers are with them and will
15:04
remain with them but why did this happen
15:07
in the first place it's a terrible story
15:09
but it's one we've heard way too many
15:11
times in Europe and unfortunately too
15:13
many times in the United States as well
15:16
an asylum Seeker often a young man in
15:19
his mid 20s already known to police Rams
15:23
a car into a crowd and shatters a
15:25
community how many times must we suffer
15:29
these appalling setbacks before we
15:31
change course and take our shared
15:34
civilization in a New
15:37
Direction no voter on this continent
15:40
went to The Ballot Box to open the
15:41
floodgates to millions of unvetted
15:45
immigrants but you know what they did
15:47
vote for in England they voted for
15:49
brexit and agree or disagree they voted
15:52
for it and more and more all over Europe
15:54
they're voting for political leaders who
15:56
promise to put an end to out of control
15:59
ation now I happen to agree with a lot
16:02
of these concerns but you don't have to
16:03
agree with me I just think that people
16:05
care about their homes they care about
16:08
their dreams they care about their
16:10
safety and their capacity to provide for
16:13
themselves and their children and
16:15
they're smart I think this is one of the
16:18
most important things I've learned in my
16:19
brief time in politics contrary to what
16:22
you might hear a couple mountains over
16:25
in Davos the citizens of all of our
16:27
Nations don't generally think of them
16:29
themselves as educated animals or as
16:31
interchangeable cogs of a global economy
16:35
and it's hardly surprising that they
16:37
don't want to be shuffled about or
16:38
relentlessly ignored by their leaders
16:41
and it is the business of democracy to
16:44
adjudicate these big questions at The
16:46
Ballot Box I believe that dismissing
16:49
people dismissing their concerns or
16:52
worse yet shutting down media shutting
16:54
down elections or shutting PE people out
16:57
of the political process us protects
17:00
nothing in fact it is the most Surefire
17:04
way to destroy
17:06
democracy and speaking up and expressing
17:09
opinions isn't election interference
17:11
even when people Express views outside
17:14
your own country and even when those
17:16
people are very
17:18
influential and trust me I say this with
17:20
all humor if American democracy can
17:23
survive 10 years of Greta thunberg's
17:26
scolding you guys can survive a few
17:28
months of el
17:30
musk but what German
17:32
democracy what no democracy American
17:36
German or european Will Survive is
17:38
telling millions of Voters that their
17:40
thoughts and concerns their aspirations
17:43
their pleas for Relief are invalid or
17:46
Unworthy of even being
17:48
considered democracy rests on the sacred
17:51
principle that the voice of the people
17:54
matters there's no room for firewalls
17:58
you either uphold the principle or you
18:02
don't Europeans the people have a voice
18:06
European leaders have a choice and my
18:10
strong belief is that we do not need to
18:13
be afraid of the
18:14
future Embrace what your people tell you
18:17
even when it's surprising even when you
18:20
don't agree and if you do so you can
18:23
face the future with certainty and with
18:24
confidence knowing that the nation
18:26
stands behind each of you
18:29
and that to me is the great magic of
18:32
democracy it's not in these Stone
18:34
buildings or beautiful hotels it's not
18:36
even in the great institutions that we
18:38
built together as a shared
18:41
Society to believe in democracy is to
18:44
understand that each of our citizens has
18:47
wisdom and has a voice and if we refuse
18:51
to listen to that voice even our most
18:53
successful fights will secure very
